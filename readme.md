Command line tool that prints out the Question Hound created by [KC Green](http://gunshowcomic.com/648) to let you know that whatever problem you're currently facing is fine.
The perfect tool to help you get through that ridiculously high [WTFs/minute code review](https://www.osnews.com/story/19266/wtfsm/).

The current release is available for Windows 10+ (x64), MacOS x64, and Linux x64.
If you have problems with any of the versions, let me know.

If you'd like a real life Question Hound, I'd highly recommend getting a plush one [here](https://topatoco.com/collections/plushes-toys/products/kcg-tfdog-plush).
